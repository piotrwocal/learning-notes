Video: Cryptographic Hash Function
	- collision-free property, nobody can find x and y such that: x!=y and H(x)=H(y)
		=> hash as message digest: H(x)=H(y) => y=x
	- hiding property, for H(x) there is no easy way to find x 

	- commitment API, commit to a value, reveal it later
		(com, key) := commit(msg)
		match := verify(com,key,msg)

		to seal msg: 
			(com, key) := commit(msg) -- publish com
		to open:
			publish key, msg -- anyone can use verify() to check validity

	    security properties:
	    	hiding: given com infeasible to find msg
	    	binding: infeasible to find msg != msg' that verify(commit(msg),msg') == true 

	 - puzzle-friendly:
	 	for every y, if k is chosen from distribution with high min-entorpy 
	 	than is infeasible to find x that: H(k|x)=y

 - Bitcoin uses SHA-256 which splits input into 512 message blocks and sends them in chain
 	 through function: hash1 = hash(iv, block1) than hash2 = hash( hash1, block2 ) etc. when iv is random
