Notes:
    - concatenated index works partially only if is applied from 'left to right'

    - index often cannot be used when combined with functions, even simple like lower(?), trim(?)

    - not using paramized queries forces db to recompile query every time
        but it's WAS  only way to impact query optimizer based on parameter values (before Postgresql 9.2)

    - LIKE expression works only for prefix cases 'abc%'
        and Postgresql by default treat bind parameters to LIKE '%abc' effectively turning off index

    - consider index merge (two indexes combined) as it is faster than checking 2 indexes and doing bitmap scan

    - consider using partial index for very uneven value distribution
