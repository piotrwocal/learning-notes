Notes:
    - concatenated index works partially only if is applied from 'left to right'

    - index often cannot be used when combined with functions, even simple like lower(?), trim(?)

    - not using paramised queries forces db to recompile query every time
        but it's WAS  only way to impact query optimizer based on parameter values (before Postgresql 9.2)
      Currently: planning on prepared statement is done 5 times during query execution with actual parameter and if
      query optimizer decides that generic plan is not more expensive than specific per params than use generic

    - LIKE expression works only for prefix cases 'abc%'
        and Postgres by default treat bind parameters to LIKE '%abc' effectively turning off index

    - consider index merge (two indexes combined) as it is faster than checking 2 indexes and doing bitmap scan

    - consider using partial index for very uneven value distribution

    - query plan without predicate information (telling which index is used for access and which for later on filtering)
       is very incomplete

    - consider using Window functions -
        syntax window_function(arg1, arg2,..) OVER (PARTITION BY expression ORDER BY expression)
        together with LAG/LEAD functions for 'relative' calculations

    - statements with bind parameters cannot be explained with direct params, we have to prepare:
        prepare stmt2( text ) as select * FROM ctpc_v01_00.channel where id = ?;
        explain execute stmt2( '1' );
