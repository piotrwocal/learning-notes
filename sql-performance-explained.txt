Notes:
    - concatenated index works partially only if is applied from 'left to right'

    - index often cannot be used when combined with functions, even simple like lower(?), trim(?)

    - not using paramized queries forces db to recompile query every time
        but it's WAS  only way to impact query optimizer based on parameter values (before Postgresql 9.2)

    - LIKE expression works only for prefix cases 'abc%'
        and Postgresql by default treat bind parameters to LIKE '%abc' effectively turning off index

    - consider index merge (two indexes combined) as it is faster than checking 2 indexes and doing bitmap scan

    - consider using partial index for very uneven value distribution

    - nested loops works well for small left side but can be highly inefficient in case of wrong planner choosing
        nested loop over hash-join, one option to force different query plan is to use CTE

    - as hash-join right side is kept in memory selecting fewer columns may improve performance

    - merge sort can be used when data are bigger and may not fit into memory, although merge-sort is initially
        expensive because it have to preproces both sides and sort them
